# Introduction-to-Python-Programming-Workshop

This repository consists of the Spell Checker project (along with supporting files) which I helped the students to create in the *Introduction to Python Programming workshop*, conducted on 5th April 2020.


### Python Spell Checker.py
This is the main spell checker code in python which takes in an input paragraph from the user and reports the number of misspelt words in that paragraph.

### smalldict.txt
This is a small self-created dictionary of commonly used words, which can be used as an initial reference to check for the validity of the spellings in paragraph.

### workshopimage.png
This is an explanatory image for the students to show them how the spell checker works.
